# Prompt 2

Is it not possible to choose a custom image size when using the API? I see that you've decided to allow 3 variables, but in most cases I'd like to specify a custom size. If it's possible, the user should be able to choose a custom size rather than any variables. If that's not a possible feature, remove the selection functionality from the UI altogether
