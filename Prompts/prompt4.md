# Prompt 4 - Claude

Hi Claude. Please find attached a Python GUI that needs some debugging with the indentation. You can probably guess its purpose: it's to provide a simple GUI to allow the user run prompts for DALLE over the openAI API. It then saves them into a specified folder which the user can share.

In addition to the debugging, please make sure that the persistent storage is somewhere outside of the repo as I might choose to share this publicly at some point and I don't want to share my credentials (obviously).

Play around with the UI and color scheme too. It could use a lot of improvement. The green scheme that DALLE itself uses is nice and should be integrated.

Return the whole script in one code block without any comments. Validate it before returning it to me to make sure that it's valid executable Python that is free of errors.
